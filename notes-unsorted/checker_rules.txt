# Board and Pieces:
The game is played on a 8x8 board, with each player having 12 pieces. Only the dark squares are used, and players place their pieces in the first three rows on their respective sides.

#Movement:
A simple piece can move diagonally forward one square.
Kings can move diagonally to any free square, both forward and backward.

Capturing:
Capturing is mandatory. If a simple piece can jump over an opponent's piece, it must do so.
The capture continues as long as there are pieces to jump over.
A piece that reaches the final line of the opponent's side is crowned as a king and can continue moving in the same sequence.

#Winning:
A player wins by capturing all the opponentâ€™s pieces or leaving them without a legal move.
The game can also end in a draw under specific conditions, such as repeated moves or if one side cannot force a win within a given number of moves.
