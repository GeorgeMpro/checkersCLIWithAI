#AI

## minimax
- (??) research and summarize to the user ( pdf format/ user interaction)
- Go over: opening book/ book moves
    first steps for the AI to use instead of calculating each time
    10-20(?) moves deep
    handling variations in the moves

    opening sequence list/dict(?)
    10-20 moves per sequence

    check when the opening moves are over and switch to minimax

- (?) explain the use and calculations of minimax
- (?) allow user to change difficulty - depth of search by the algorithm
    notice: might slow down responsives

## a,b pruning
- (?) using a,b, pruning: explain the use and calculations
